Approaches to finding model structure and parameters may be knowledge-supported, or data-driven [@Boets:2015gl]. Model selection methods can include traditional inferential approaches such as unconstrained searches of a dataset for patterns that explain variations in the response variable, or use of ensemble-modelling methods (Barnard et al. 2019). Ensemble modelling procedures might aim to derive a single model, or a multi-model average [@Yates2018].

These criteria and their underlying assumptions should reflect the desired properties of the parameter estimates / structure [@Jakeman:2006ii]. For example, modellers might seek that parameter estimates are robust to outliers, unbiased, and yield appropriate predictive performance. Modellers will need to consider whether the assumptions of the estimation technique yielding those desired criteria are appropriate to the problem at hand. For integrated or sub-divided models, other considerations might include choices about where to disaggregate the model for parameter estimation; e.g. spatial sectioning (streams into reaches) and temporal sectioning (piece-wise linear models) [@Jakeman:2006ii].Specifying performance criteria a priori is important because it involves pre-specifying how the fitted or quantitative model will be interpreted in advance, avoiding biases like confirmation bias, HARKing, and cherry-picking some performance tests from the full suite of tests undertaken.This is important - because it involves pre-specifying how we will interpret the fitted or quantitative model to avoid cognitive biases like confirmation bias, HARKing or other questionable research practices.",egould,25/04/2020,egould,8/05/2020

Qualitative tests could include syntax checking of code, and code reviews by peers. Checks for verification implementation should include i) thoroughy checking for bugs or programming errors,  and ii) whether the implemented model performs as dictated by the model description  [@Grimm:2014es]. Specifying up front QA tests for implementation verification may help to avoid selective debugging. ",egould,25/04/2020,egould,9/05/2020

During this process, observed data, or data and patterns that guided model design and calibration is compared to model output in order to identify if and where there are any systematic differences. Model checking therefore heps diagnose assumption violations, and reveals where a model might need to be altered to better represent the data, and therefore system [@Conn:2018hd]. Quantitative model checking diagnostics include goodness of fit, tests on residuals or errors, such as for heteroscedascity, cross-correlation, and autocorrelation [@Jakeman:2006ii].

●,5.0- Model Validation and Evaluation,11,4,"coded_phase, PRT item",2,"Model Validation & Evaluation - This phase consists of a suite of analyses that collectively inform the decision and whether and when a model is suitable to meet its intended purpose (Augusiak, Van den Brink and Grimm 2014). Errors in design and implementation of the model and their implication on the model output are assessed. Ideally independent data is used against the model outputs to assess whether the model output behaviour exhibits the required accuracy for the model’s intended purpose. The outcomes of these analyses build confidence in the model applications and increase understandingof model strengths and limitations.Model evaluation including model analysis and other testing should complement model checking. It should evaluate model checking, and consider over-fitting and extrapolation. “The higher the proportion of calibrated, or uncertain parameters, the greater the risk that the model seems to work correctly […] but for the wrong reasons” Evaluation thus complements model checking because we can rule out the chance that the model fits the calibration data well, but has not captured the relevant ecological mecahnisms of the system (Grimm).Evaluation of model outputs against external data in conjunction with the results from model checking provide information about the structural realism and therefore credibility of the model (Grimm et al. 2014).",egould,23/04/2020,egould,9/05/2020

Independent predictions can instead be tested on submodels. Alternatively, patterns in model output that are robust and seem characteristic of the system can be identified and evaluated in consultation with the literature or by experts to judge how accurate the model’s output is (Grimm et al.2014).

●,5.4- Model Validation and Evaluation: model analysis,27,1,"coded_decision_step, PRT item",2,"Uncertainty in models arises due to incomplete system understanding (which processes to include, or which interact), from imprecise, finite and sparese data measurements, and from uncertainty in input conditions and scenarios for model simulations or runs [@Jakeman:2006ii]. Non-technical uncertainties can also be introduced throughout the modellign process, such as uncertainties arising from issues in problem-framing, indeterminicies, and modeller / client values [@Jakeman:2006ii].The purpose of model analysis is to prevent blind trust in the model by understanding how model outputs have emerged, and to ‘challenge’ the model by verifying whether the model is still believeable and fit for purpose if one or more parameters are changed [@Grimm:2014es]. Model analysis should increase understanding of the model behaviour by identifying which processes and process interactions explain characteristic behaviours of the model system. Model analysis typically consists of sensitivity analyses preceded by uncertainty analyses [@Saltelli2019], and a suite of other simulation or other computational experiments. The aim of such computational experiments is to increase understanding of the model behaviour by identifying which processes and process interactions explain characteristic behaviours of the model system [@Grimm:2014es].Uncertainty analyses and sensitivity analyses augment one another to draw conclusions about model uncertainty — the overall model will be very uncertain if the parameters that are the most uncertain are the ones the model is most uncertain to., for instance.Because the results from a full suite of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis can be difficult to interpret due to the number and complexity of causal relations examined [@Jakeman:2006ii], it is useful for the analyst to relate the choice of analysis to the modelling context, purpose and analytical objectives defined in the problem formulation phase, in tandem with any critical uncertainties that have emerged during model development and testing prior to this point.
