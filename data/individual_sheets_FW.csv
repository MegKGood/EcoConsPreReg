FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,"Vague project topic (starting of a new job) + discussion with colleagues about issue (i.e. invasive plant, what were the impacts of flooding on it?)",1
FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,organised meeting / visit to site with land manager. - discuss issue - see location -> ideas.etc - important to visit site first?? I found this hugely valuable.,2
FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,"survey plan, site selection - data collection approach - e.g. quadrat size, variables to collect",3
FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,survey in field. Adjustment of method when things didn't work. E.g. moving some sites to capture rush as GIS maps were wrong.,4
FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,Survey dates were a bit ad hoc as couldn't predict flow patterns -> visits as required as hydrograph changed.,5
FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,Flow predictor variables -> method wasn't finalised till a long time after surveys finished. Worked out in the field how to quantify flooding depths.,6
FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,Stats assistance also sought well after fieldwork ended.,7
FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,Entire analysis reworked after reject and resubit from a journal. Then subsequently accepted.,8
FW,8,Survey of Giant Rush response to floods at Barmah Forest.,NA,Conceptual thinking developed refined during course of multiple survey (Alternative stable states in the forest).,9

FW,10,"Understand the relationshp between fire frequency, severity and plant trait group responses",NA,"Data analysis. Model didn't fit very well, different modelling approach chosen. Would have been good to do this earlier. ",6
FW,10,"Understand the relationshp between fire frequency, severity and plant trait group responses",NA,First draft manuscript. Co-authors suggested additional analysis. Which means hypothesising after data collection.,7
