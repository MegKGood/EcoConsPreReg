Ensure that you specify any focal taxa and study objectives, as well as any clients for whom the model is developed for. Briefly outline the ecological problem and the decision-problem, including the decision-trigger and any regulatory frameworks relevant to the problem.",1,egould,1/05/2020,egould,8/05/2020

1.2.2 - Model Scope and Scale,2,1,PRT item,"Determine the temporal and spatial scope of the model. Where is the boundary of the modelled system? Everything beyond the boundary and not crossing it is to be ignored within the domain of the model, and everything crossing the boundary is to be treated as external forcing (known/unknown), or else as model outputs (observed, or not, Jakeman et al. 2006).The choice of a model’s boundaries is closely linked to the choice of how finely to aggregate the behaviour within the model (Jakeman et al., 2006) - what is the intended scale and resolution of the model (temporal, spatial or otherwise)?Explain how any key concepts or terms within problem or decision-making contexts, such as regulatory terms, will be operationalised and defined in a biologically meaningful way to answer the research question appropriately? (Should this last step go here or within define conceptual framework?).What is the intended domain of applicability of the model, what is the extent of acceptable extrapolations (Grimm)? This is relevant to model transferability... (similar to a COG statement..)",1,egould,1/05/2020,egould,8/05/2020

What degree of flexibility is required from the model? Might the model need to be quickly reconfigured to explore new scenarios or problems proposed by clients / managers / model-users?",1,egould,1/05/2020,egould,8/05/2020
1.3.2-Identify outcomes to evaluate decisions under scenarios,1,1,PRT item,"The outcomes should speak directly to the analytical objectives identified in 1.3.1. Outcomes could be qualitative or quantitative, and include descriptive statistic measures, satisficing measures or regret measures (Moallemi et al. 2019). For example, a model outcome in the top 10th percentile of worst conditions, or some minimum performance threshold for meeting a performance objective, or choosing a decision with the minimum regret or least amount of uncertainty.",1,egould,1/05/2020,egould,8/05/2020

2.4.3-Describe any data exploration or preliminary data analyses.,1,1,PRT item,"In most modelling cases, it is necessary to perform preliminary analyses to understand the data and check that assumptions and requirements of the chosen modelling procedures are met. Data exploration prior to model fitting or development may include exploratory analyses to check for collinearity, spatial and temporal coverage, quality and resolution, outliers, or the need for transformations [@Yates2018]. Describe how you will summarise and explore your data, and explain what method you will use (graphical, tabular or otherwise) to represent your data and any analyses.",1,egould,7/05/2020,egould,8/05/2020
2.4.4-Data Evaluation,2,1,PRT item,"Describe how you will evaluate the quality and sources of both numerical and qualitative data that available for model parameterisation, and for determining the overall model structure [@Grimm:2014es]. Ideally, model input data should be internally consistent across temporal and spatial scales and resolutions, and appropriate to the problem at hand [@Mahmoud2009]. Document any issues with data reliability. This is important because data quality and ecological relevance might be constrained by measurement error, inappropriate experimental design, and heterogeneity and variability inherent in ecological systems [@Grimm:2014es].

3.2.1-Explain how you will operationalise response variable(s),1,1,PRT item,"Specify how you will operationalise response variables in the model. This should relate directly to the analytical and or management objectives specified during the problem formulation phase. Specifications could include:- qualitative change, such as a direction of change- the extent of a response- an extreme value- a trend- a long-term mean- a probability distribution- a spatial pattern- a time-series, or- the frequency, location, or probability of some event occuring.Provide a rationale for your choices, including why plausible alternatives were not chosen (Jakeman, 2006).",1,egould,7/05/2020,egould,8/05/2020
3.2.3-Choose model family,3,1,PRT item,"Specify which family of statistical distributions you will use in your model, and describe any transformations, or link functions. Justify your decision based on the purpose, objectives, prior knowledge and logistical constraints (Jakeman, 2006) specified in the problem formulation phase.

3.2.3-Choose model features,3,1,PRT item,"Specify which types of variables are covered in the model, and the nature of their treatment (e.g. lumped/distributed, linear/non-linear, stochastic/deterministic, Jakeman, 2006).

3.4.1-Choice of estimation performance criteria,5,1,,"Specify which suite of performance criteria you will use to judge the performance of the model. Examples include correlation scores, coefficient of determination, specificity, sensitivity, AUC, etcetera (Yates et al. 2018). Relate any underlying assumptions of each criterion to the desired properties of the model, and justify the choice of performance metric in relation into whether it is sensitive to the problem at hand. Explain how you will identify which model features or components are significant or meaningful.",0,egould,8/05/2020,egould,8/05/2020
3.4.2-Choice of structure and parameter estimation technique,2,1,,"Specify what technique you will use to estimate parameter values, and how you will supply non-parametric variables and/or data (e.g. distributed boundary conditions). For example, will you calibrate all variables simultaneously by optimising fi of model outputs to observations, or will you parameterise the model in a piecemeal fashion by either direct measurement, inference from secondary data, or some combination (Jakeman, 2006). Identify which variables were parameterised directly, such as by expert elicitation or prior knowledge.Specify which algorithm(s) you will use for any data-driven structure / parameter estimation, including supervised, or unsupervised machine learning, decision-tree, K-nearest neighbour or cluster algorithms [@Liu2018b].",73,egould,8/05/2020,egould,8/05/2020
4.3.1-Model Checking-quantitative tests,9,1,,"Specify any diagnostics or tests you will use during model checking.

4.3.2-Qualitative Model Checking,5,1,,"This step is largely informal and case-specific, but requires ‘face validation’ with model users / clients / managers who aren’t involved in the development of the model to assess whether the interactions and outcomes of the model are feasible an ddefensible  [@Grimm:2014es]. This process could be called a “laugh test” or a “pub test, and in addition to checking the model’s believability, it builds the client’s confidence in the model [@Jakeman:2006ii]. Face validation could include structured walk-throughs, or presenting descriptions, visualisations or summaries of model results to experts for assessment. Briefly explain how you will qualitatively check the model, and whether + how you will include users and clients in the process.",0,egould,9/05/2020,egould,9/05/2020
5.4.1- Uncertainty Analyses,6,1,,"Uncertainty can arise from different modeling techniques, response data and predictor variables [@Araujo2019]. Uncertainty analyses characterise the uncertainty in model outputs, and identifies how uncertainty in model parameters affects uncertainty in model output, but does not identify which model assumptions are driving this behaviour [@Grimm:2014es;@Saltelli2019]. Uncertainty analyses can include propagating known uncertainties through the model, or by investigating the effect of different model scenarios with different parameters and modelling technique combinations [@Araujo2019], for example. It also includes characterising the output distribution, for example ""by constructing it empirically from model output data points”. It could also include extracting summary statistics like the mean, median and variance from this distribution, and perhaps constructing confidence intervals on the mean [@Saltelli2019].Please describe how you will characterise any suspected critical model and data uncertainties, as well as how you plan on summarising the results of these experiments with graphical, tabular or other devices.Relate your choice of analysis to the context and purposes of the model described in the problem formulation phase. For instance “discrepancies between model output and observed output may be important for forecasting models, where cost, benefit, an risk over a substantial period must be gauged, but much less critical for decision-making or management models where the user may be satisfied with knowing that the predicted ranking order of impcats of alternative scenarios or management options is likely to be correct, with only a rough indication of their sizes” [@Jakeman:2006ii].If the chosen modelling approach is able to explicitly articulate uncertainty due to data, measurements or baseline conditions, such as by providing estimates of uncertainty (typically in the form of probabilistic paraameter covariance, [@Jakeman:2006ii]), specify which measure of uncertainty you will measure.",0,egould,9/05/2020,egould,9/05/2020
5.4.2- Sensitivity Analyses,7,1,,"Sensitivity analysis may improve understanding processes within models, and therefore on the natural system, or else as a quality assurance tool - sensitivity analyses may reveal logical or implementation errors in the model Sensitivity analysis examines how uncertainty in model outputs can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in model input [@Saltelli2019]. Model sensitivity can be evaluated using 3 approaches: 1. deterministic sensitivity, stochastic sensitivity (variability in the model), or scenario sensitivity (effect of changes based on scenarios).Describe any sensitivity analyses you will conduct by specifying the initial conditions and input data for each analysis - i.e. which parameters will be held constant, which will be varied, and the range and intervals of values over which those parameterrs will be varied. Where there were critical uncertainties or multiple plausible representations of a submodel, sensitivity analyses can be used to constract alternative submodels [@Grimm:2014es]. This analysis can be used for ‘pattern-oriented theory development’ which analyses which submodel causes the full model to most closely reproduce a set of observed patterns? [@Grimm:2014es]State the primary objective of each sensitvity analysis, for example, a common objective is to identify which input variables contribute the most to model uncertainty so that these variables can be targeted for further data collection, or altertantively to identify which variables or factors contribute little to overall model outputs, and so can be ‘dropped’ from future iterations of the model [@Saltelli2019].What information should be reported to reproduce a sensitvity analysis should guide us as to what information we should get people to report now.",0,egould,9/05/2020,egould,9/05/2020
